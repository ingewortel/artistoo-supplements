Interactive simulations are HTML pages that run in the web browser. To view an 
interactive simulation from your web browser, please download the complete repository,
 and double click the simulation inside the interactive-html directory. Please note that 
 these web pages load files from `./build/` and from `./interactive-html/src/`. 
 An isolated HTML file copied to some other folder will therefore not work;
please copy the entire directory or update the paths in the HTML file.
