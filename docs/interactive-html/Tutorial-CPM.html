<h1>Tutorial: Introduction to the CPM</h1>

<p style="font-size:120%">This tutorial walks through the 
 Cellular Potts Model (CPM) in its basic form. It requires no upfront knowledge on the CPM and
contains interactive components to illustrate how the algorithm works.
</p>

<h2>1. Framework Basics</h2>

<h3>1.1 The CPM in Space: The Grid</h3>

<p>The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) is what we call <i>discrete</i> in space: it 
essentially describes space like a low-resolution image,
zoomed in far enough that you can see the individual pixels. Each pixel \(p\) belongs 
to either the empty "background" or to a "cell" on that surface:
$$ \text{cell}(p) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{background} \\
1 & \text{cell with ID = 1} \\
2 & \text{cell with ID = 2} \\
... & etc
\end{cases}$$

The entire space described by our model is then called the CPM "grid" or "lattice". 
For example, a grid with two square cells could look like this:

<div>
	<iframe src="./frame-gridstate.html" width="100%" height="200px"></iframe>
</div>


These pixel identities vary in both space (different pixels have different identities) 
and time (pixels can switch their cell identity over time):

$$\text{cell} = f(p,t)$$ 

For example :

<div>
	<iframe src="./frame-gridstate-dynamic.html" width="100%" height="200px"></iframe>
</div>

Now, let's explore where these identity changes come from.</p>

<h3>1.2 Physical Laws in the CPM World: Energies and the Hamiltonian</h3>

<p> CPM cells move because they continuously try to "conquer" pixels from other cells
(or from the background). This is why the grid state \(\text{cell} (p,t)\) changes over 
time. These changes are stochastic but not completely random: in their competition for 
pixels, cells try to minimize the global <i>energy</i> of the system, defined by the 
<i>Hamiltonian</i> \(H\). (Mostly, this minimization does not actually "work" in the sense
that the model never reaches a steady state, but it <i>does</i> guide behaviour in the model).
</p>

<p> How these energies are computed depends on the exact model
	and will be discussed in more detail below; but the idea is that this general 
	mechanism allows us to define a set of "rules" or "physical laws" that the CPM cells
	tend to follow in their dynamic game of conquering pixels. 
</p>

<p>The question remains: how does this energy minimization work? </p>

<h3>1.3 The CPM in Time: Dynamics and the Metropolis Algorithm</h3>

<p>The CPM controls its global energy \(H\) through the so-called Metropolis algorithm:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pick a random pixel on the grid as the "source" pixel \(p_s\);</li>
	<li>Pick a random neighbor of \(s\) as the "target" pixel \(p_t\);</li>
	<li>If \(\text{cell}(p_s,t) \neq \text{cell}(p_t, t)\) (i.e., the pixels do
	not belong to the same cell), then 
	let \(p_s\) try to "copy" itself into \(p_t\) such that 
	$$\text{cell}(p_t,t+1) \stackrel{?}{=} \text{cell}(p_s,t)$$
	Note the "try" in the previous sentence; this so-called "copy attempt" only 
	succeeds with chance
	$$P_\text{copy} = \begin{cases}
	e^{-\Delta H/T} & \Delta H \gt 0\\
	1 & \Delta H \leq 0 \end{cases}$$
	Here, \(\Delta H\) is the energetic effect the copy attempt, if successful, would have:
	\(\Delta H \leq 0\) indicates an "energetically favourable" change, while 
	\(\Delta H \gt 0\) indicates an unfavourable change.  The temperature \(T\) is a model 
	parameter that controls noise: the higher the temperature, the more likely that
	energetically unfavourable copy attempts will succeed. 
	<li>Repeat steps 1-3 \(N\) times, where \(N\) equals the total number of
	pixels on the grid. After those \(N\) copy attempts (whether they succeed or
	not), the model time progresses with one <i>Monte Carlo Step (MCS)</i>, the time
	unit of the CPM)</li>
</ol> 

<p>You can walk through these dynamics below; click "step" to perform the next step
of the algorithm manually, or click the play symbol to automatically perform the 
steps at a faster pace. (Don't worry about the value of &Delta;H for now; that is
discussed in the next section.)</p>

<h2>2. Constructing the Hamiltonian</h2>

<p> We have already talked briefly about the <i>Hamiltonian</i> \(H\), the global 
energy that the system tries to minimize. Typically, this Hamiltonian contains
different terms to encourage different processes. For example:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Adhesion</b>: Pixels belonging to the same cell try to stick together; 
	essentially, we put a penalty on every black pixel next to a gray pixel.</li>
	<li><b>Maintaining size and shape</b>: Cells have a target volume and/or perimeter. 
	They can deviate a little from that value by stretching or compressing, but they
	more or less maintain their size and membrane.</li>
</ol>

<p>This would give the following Hamiltonian:
$$H_\text{tot} = H_\text{adhesion} + H_\text{volume} + H_\text{perimeter}$$

However, note that we never really use \(H\) itself; we only ever look at \(\Delta H\), 
the <i>change</i> in energy that would occur if the copy attempt were to succeed:
$$\Delta H_\text{tot} = \Delta H_\text{adhesion} + \Delta H_\text{volume} + \Delta H_\text{perimeter}$$</p>



<p>In the following, we'll see what these terms look like.
</p>



<h3>2.1 Adhesion</h3>

<p>The adhesive energy is a <i>contact energy</i> that ensures that pixels from the
same cell stay together. For a CPM with a single cell, where there are only two
identities (0 for the background, 1 for the cell), this is defined as:
	$$H_\text{adhesion} = \sum_{\substack{\text{neighbors } i,j \\ \text{cell}(i) \neq \text{cell}(j)}} J$$
where we sum over pairs of <i>neighboring</i> pixels \(i,j\) on the grid. 
In other words: we assign a positive energy (i.e. a penalty) to every pair of 
neighboring pixels that do not belong to the same cell. The parameter \(J\) controls
the strength of this penalty. 
</p>
<p>
To get \(\Delta H\) for a proposed copy attempt, we then compute:
$$\Delta H_\text{adhesion} = H_\text{adhesion,after copy} - H_\text{adhesion, now}$$
</p>

<p>Below, these contacts are visualized; click "step()" to complete an MCS in the
grid and to see the adhesion energy after the changes. </p>

<div>
	<iframe src="./frame-adhesion-basic.html" width="100%" height="330px"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Note that the simulation start with random assignment of pixels to the "cell" or
"background". Over time, pixels with the same identity tend to cluster together in space,
and finally, the grid has only one identity left (it is then either empty, or completely
filled with one cell).</p>


<p>The same principle applies when there is more than one cell, except now we have to define
<i>multiple</i> contact energies \(J\): the interface between two different cells
gets a different energy \((J_\text{cell,cell})\) than the interface between 
one of the cells and the background \((J_\text{cell,bg})\):</p>

<div>
	<iframe src="./frame-adhesion-multi.html" width="100%" height="360px"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Again, after enough time passes, the grid ends up homogeneous. This happens because
the energetic penalty of cell-cell or cell-background interfaces means that there is 
a simple way to have no penalty: removing all the interfaces! With the tendency
of the CPM to minimize the global energy, we eventually end up in this minimum energy,
steady state scenario. If we wish to have real cells, we need to expand our Hamiltonian.
</p>



<h3>2.2 Volume</h3>

<p>To describe units that look more like cells, the Hamiltonian of  a Cellular Potts 
Model (CPM) typically contains a volume term that ensures that cells roughly maintain 
their size (measured in number of pixels):
$$H_\text{volume} =  \sum_{i \in \text{cells}} \lambda_\text{volume}(V_i - V_t)^2$$
For every cell, this terms assigns an energetic penalty that depends quadratically 
on how much its current volume \(V_i\) deviates from 
some target value \(V_t\) (which is a model parameter). A second parameter, 
\(\lambda_\text{volume}\), is used to further scale this energy.
</p>

<p>Once again, what we actually use is the energy difference:
$$\Delta H_\text{volume} = H_\text{volume,after copy} - H_\text{volume, now}$$
</p>

<p>This result in an elastic-like behavior. There is no complete conservation of mass
because cells <i>can</i> deviate from their target volume by stretching or compressing a 
little, but these deviations remain small due to the quadratic penalty they carry with
them. If a cell is already too large, it won't easily gain more pixels. And vice versa,
if it is too small, it won't easily lose them.</p>

<p>The following example illustrates this for a simple cell with a target volume of 9
pixels and &lambda;<sub>volume</sub> = 20:</p>

<h3>2.3 Perimeter</h3>

<h2>3 Try It Yourself</h2>

<p>Below, you can explore the basic CPM rules by toggling the different rules (adhesion,
maintaining volume, and maintaining perimeter). You can also set the size of the volume or
perimeter the cell tries to maintain. </p>

<div>
	<iframe src="./frame-singlecell.html" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Suggestions to try:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Toggle both perimeter and volume off so that the only rule is "adhesion". You
	should see the cell disappear (after all, the best way to have no black pixels next
	to gray ones is to have no black pixels at all!)</li>
	<li>Get your cell back by clicking reset. Now disable "adhesion" while leaving
	volume and perimeter intact. Not much should happen; the perimeter by itself is
	already keeping the cells together. Now also disable the perimeter, leaving only
	the volume 'on'. The cell should fall apart.</li>
	<li>Turn adhesion back on (you should now have volume and adhesion) until the cell
	reforms; if it doesn't, click reset. Switch the perimeter back on and play with 
	the perimeter setting. If you set it very low, the cell should become quite round
	and rigid. If you set the perimeter large, it should have a strongly fluctuating 
	border.</li>
	<li>Increase the volume. Note that to keep the same shape, you also have to increase
	the perimeter somewhat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>All in all, we have seen here how the CPM consists of a discrete grid combined with 
energy-based kinetics. The energy "rules" like <b>adhesion</b>, <b>volume</b> and
<b>perimeter</b> <i>interact</i> to yield cell behaviour. The cell has dynamic borders and
can kind of float around (especially if you give it a large perimeter), but there is no
real "active" motion; that is the topic of a later tutorial.</p>
