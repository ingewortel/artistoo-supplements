# Applications

The following applications are referred to in the manuscript, and are available in this
repository:

### Application S1: Teaching material
An example exercise used to for teaching workshops on the CPM for beginning users. 
Readers are free to use this material in their own education. Open the pdf to view the
exercise. This file refers to an online simulation, but the same simulation is included 
as Interactive Simulation S6 in the `interactive-html/` folder. The `.tex` file is also
provided so that readers can adapt the exercise for their own purposes.


### Application S2: Slide set
An example slideshow containing a live Artistoo simulation. The slides were built using 
the [https://revealjs.com](revealjs framework), which allows users to build slidesets in 
HTML. To view, please download the repository and open 
`applications/slides-example/index.html` in your web browser. The simulations here use the 
artistoo build in the `build/` folder, so if files are moved elsewhere, please check and 
update the links in the HTML files in `applications/slides-example/simulations/`.

### Application S3: Poster website
A website accompanying a conference poster, which can be shared via a QR code on the 
poster itself. Please visit [https://computational-immunology.org/inge/poster-cpmjs/](https://computational-immunology.org/inge/poster-cpmjs/) 
to view this example.
