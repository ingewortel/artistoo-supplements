# Artistoo: build, share, and explore simulations of cells and tissues in the web browser (Supplementary Materials)

This repository contains supplementary materials (source code and simulations) for the 
manuscript *"Artistoo: build, share, and explore simulations of cells and tissues in the 
web browser"* on our software package [Artistoo](https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo). 
See also the [web interface](https://ingewortel.github.io/artistoo-supplements)
for easy access to supplementary files.

This repository contains the following types of supplementary materials:

- *Source code:* the `code/` folder contains node scripts of Artistoo simulations used
	to assess performance. See the README in `code/` for details on how to use these files;
- *Interactive simulations* the `interactive-html/` folder contains examples of 
	interactive Artistoo simulations built as HTML pages. 
	See the README in `interactive-html/`.
- *Applications:* the `applications/` folder contains example applications of Artistoo,
	showing how interactive simulations can facilitate teaching, research, and science 
	dissemination. See the README in `applications/` for details.

In addition, the repository contains a directory `build/` which contains the artistoo
source code for completeness (this code can also be obtained from the 
[Artistoo repository](https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo) ).
