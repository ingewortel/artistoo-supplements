# Artistoo: build, share, and explore simulations of cells and tissues in the web browser (Supplementary Materials)

This repository contains supplementary materials (source code and simulations) for the 
manuscript *"Artistoo: build, share, and explore simulations of cells and tissues in the 
web browser"* on our software package [Artistoo](github.com/ingewortel/artistoo). 

This repository contains the following types of supplementary materials:

- *Source code:* the `code/` folder contains node scripts of Artistoo simulations used
	to assess performance, as well as xml format model files of the same simulations 
	built in the Morpheus framework. See below for details on how to use these files;
- *Interactive simulations* the `interactive-html/` folder contains examples of 
	interactive Artistoo simulations built as HTML pages. See below for access.
- *Applications:* the `applications/` folder contains example applications of Artistoo,
	showing how interactive simulations can facilitate teaching, research, and science 
	dissemination. See below for details.

In addition, the repository contains a directory `build/` which contains the artistoo
source code for completeness (this code can also be obtained from the 
[Artistoo repository](github.com/ingewortel/artistoo) ).
